    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. An efficient algorithm is one that can solve a problem in the least amount of time, especially with large datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
        Space Complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. For example, an algorithm with an O(n) space complexity means the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
